King Henry III was so irked by the problem that he implemented a new law to standardize the weight of a loafâ€”selling puny loaves could result in beatings or jail time. Since bakers wanted to stay on the right side of the law, one common trick was to give 13 loaves to any customer buying a dozen. Even if the loaves were light, the extra would cover the shortfall.`
